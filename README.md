Welcome to our What's Changed web application!  

This application was programmed by Esther Chung, Diana Damenova, Brendan Pulju, David Tran, and Naqia Zaveri. This application was built with several tools. The Django framework was used for the backend, Bootstrap 4 was used for the frontend, Postgres was used for database services, Google's Javascript API was used for the map feature, Travis was used for integration testing, and Heroku was used for deployment.

To begin using the application, try the following steps.
